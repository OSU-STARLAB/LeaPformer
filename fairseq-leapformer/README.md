# Introduction
FAIR Sequence-to-Sequence Toolkit (PyTorch)

This is a PyTorch version of [fairseq](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq), a sequence-to-sequence learning toolkit from Facebook AI Research. The original authors of this reimplementation are (in no particular order) Sergey Edunov, Myle Ott, and Sam Gross. The toolkit implements the fully convolutional model described in [Convolutional Sequence to Sequence Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03122) and features multi-GPU training on a single machine as well as fast beam search generation on both CPU and GPU. We provide pre-trained models for English to French and English to German translation.

# Requirements and Installation
* A computer running macOS or Linux
* For training new models, you'll also need a NVIDIA GPU and [NCCL](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl)
* Python version 3.6
* A [PyTorch installation](http://pytorch.org/)

Currently fairseq-py requires installing PyTorch from source.
Please follow the instructions here: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch#from-source.

If you use Docker make sure to increase the shared memory size either with `--ipc=host` or `--shm-size` as command line
options to `nvidia-docker run`.

After PyTorch is installed, you can install fairseq-py with:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py build
python setup.py develop
```

# Quick Start

The following command-line tools are available:
* `python preprocess.py`: Data pre-processing: build vocabularies and binarize training data
* `python train.py`: Train a new model on one or multiple GPUs
* `python generate.py`: Translate pre-processed data with a trained model
* `python interactive.py`: Translate raw text with a trained model
* `python score.py`: BLEU scoring of generated translations against reference translations

## Evaluating Pre-trained Models
First, download a pre-trained model along with its vocabularies:
```
$ curl https://s3.amazonaws.com/fairseq-py/models/wmt14.en-fr.fconv-py.tar.bz2 | tar xvjf -
```

This model uses a [Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) vocabulary](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.07909), so we'll have to apply the encoding to the source text before it can be translated.
This can be done with the [apply_bpe.py](https://github.com/rsennrich/subword-nmt/blob/master/apply_bpe.py) script using the `wmt14.en-fr.fconv-cuda/bpecodes` file.
`@@` is used as a continuation marker and the original text can be easily recovered with e.g. `sed s/@@ //g` or by passing the `--remove-bpe` flag to `generate.py`.
Prior to BPE, input text needs to be tokenized using `tokenizer.perl` from [mosesdecoder](https://github.com/moses-smt/mosesdecoder).

Let's use `python interactive.py` to generate translations interactively.
Here, we use a beam size of 5:
```
$ MODEL_DIR=wmt14.en-fr.fconv-py
$ python interactive.py \
 --path $MODEL_DIR/model.pt $MODEL_DIR \
 --beam 5
| loading model(s) from wmt14.en-fr.fconv-py/model.pt
| [en] dictionary: 44206 types
| [fr] dictionary: 44463 types
| Type the input sentence and press return:
> Why is it rare to discover new marine mam@@ mal species ?
O       Why is it rare to discover new marine mam@@ mal species ?
H       -0.06429661810398102    Pourquoi est-il rare de découvrir de nouvelles espèces de mammifères marins ?
A       0 1 3 3 5 6 6 8 8 8 7 11 12
```

This generation script produces four types of outputs: a line prefixed with *S* shows the supplied source sentence after applying the vocabulary; *O* is a copy of the original source sentence; *H* is the hypothesis along with an average log-likelihood; and *A* is the attention maxima for each word in the hypothesis, including the end-of-sentence marker which is omitted from the text.

Check [below](#pre-trained-models) for a full list of pre-trained models available.


## Training a New Model

### Data Pre-processing
The fairseq-py source distribution contains an example pre-processing script for
the IWSLT 2014 German-English corpus.
Pre-process and binarize the data as follows:
```
$ cd data/
$ bash prepare-iwslt14.sh
$ cd ..
$ TEXT=data/iwslt14.tokenized.de-en
$ python preprocess.py --source-lang de --target-lang en \
  --trainpref $TEXT/train --validpref $TEXT/valid --testpref $TEXT/test \
  --destdir data-bin/iwslt14.tokenized.de-en
```
This will write binarized data that can be used for model training to `data-bin/iwslt14.tokenized.de-en`.

### Training
Use `python train.py` to train a new model.
Here a few example settings that work well for the IWSLT 2014 dataset:
```
$ mkdir -p checkpoints/fconv
$ CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python train.py data-bin/iwslt14.tokenized.de-en \
  --lr 0.25 --clip-norm 0.1 --dropout 0.2 --max-tokens 4000 \
  --arch fconv_iwslt_de_en --save-dir checkpoints/fconv
```

By default, `python train.py` will use all available GPUs on your machine.
Use the [CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES](http://acceleware.com/blog/cudavisibledevices-masking-gpus) environment variable to select specific GPUs and/or to change the number of GPU devices that will be used.

Also note that the batch size is specified in terms of the maximum number of tokens per batch (`--max-tokens`).
You may need to use a smaller value depending on the available GPU memory on your system.

### Generation
Once your model is trained, you can generate translations using `python generate.py` **(for binarized data)** or `python interactive.py` **(for raw text)**:
```
$ python generate.py data-bin/iwslt14.tokenized.de-en \
  --path checkpoints/fconv/checkpoint_best.pt \
  --batch-size 128 --beam 5
  | [de] dictionary: 35475 types
  | [en] dictionary: 24739 types
  | data-bin/iwslt14.tokenized.de-en test 6750 examples
  | model fconv
  | loaded checkpoint trainings/fconv/checkpoint_best.pt
  S-721   danke .
  T-721   thank you .
  ...
```

To generate translations with only a CPU, use the `--cpu` flag.
BPE continuation markers can be removed with the `--remove-bpe` flag.

$ python score.py --sys /tmp/gen.out.sys --ref /tmp/gen.out.ref
BLEU4 = 40.67, 67.7/46.7/34.2/25.3 (BP=1.000, ratio=0.998, syslen=81377, reflen=81194)
